The goal of this thesis is to explore a new method of determining the colors of objects, apply that technique to survey images of Euclid and Rubin, and determine the photometric redshift of objects. 

First, the algorithm is explained. Subsequently, the method's limitations and accuracy are evaluated using simulations. Next, this method is applied to Euclid and Rubin images. Lastly, the colors determined with the GAAP method are used to fit the spectra and derive the photometric redshift.
