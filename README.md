This is the GitHub repository for my first research project.
This project is about Gaussian Aperture and Photometry (GAAP). 
This is a technique to determine accurate colors from survey images by deconvolving the weight function. 
The goal is to use the more accurate colors to find better estimations for the photometric redshifts, which can be used to learn moreabout the evolution of the universe.
